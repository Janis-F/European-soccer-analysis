# Ultimate 25k+ matches European Football Database Analysis

The Ultimate 25k+ Matches Football Database contains a wealth of information on European football matches and teams. 

In this project, I analyzed this data to identify trends and patterns that could inform a betting company's decisions in the European football market. By exploring the relationships between team attributes, player performance, and match outcomes, I hope to provide a competitive advantage and improve the accuracy of the company's predictions.

To achieve these goals, I will conduct exploratory data analysis, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. Through this process, I hope to uncover insights that will help the company make informed and profitable betting decisions in the football market.
