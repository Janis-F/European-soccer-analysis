# Ultimate 25k+ matches European Football Database Analysis

The Ultimate 25k+ Matches Football Database contains a wealth of information on European football matches and teams. 

In this project, I analyzed this data to identify trends and patterns that could inform a betting company's decisions in the European football market. By exploring the relationships between team attributes, player performance, and match outcomes, I hope to provide a competitive advantage and improve the accuracy of the company's predictions.

To achieve these goals, I will conduct exploratory data analysis, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. Through this process, I hope to uncover insights that will help the company make informed and profitable betting decisions in the football market.

## Main Findings

- Lionel Messi was the top scorer from 2008-2015 with 295 goals in Spain's La Liga.
- Teams have a statistically significant higher win rate when playing at home.
- French league has low-scoring matches, while German and Spanish leagues have high-scoring matches.
- English league teams excel at creating chances via crossing, while German teams are better at passing.
- A model predicting match winners had a 52% accuracy but struggles with predicting draws.
- A goal prediction model has 25% overall accuracy, performing well for 1-4 goals but poorly for other results.
- Model performance can be improved by incorporating more relevant features and analyzing feature importance.
